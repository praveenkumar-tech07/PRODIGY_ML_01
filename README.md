## Task 1: Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on:

- 🏠 Square Footage (`GrLivArea`)
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- 🛁 Number of Bathrooms (`FullBath`)

---

### 📂 Dataset
[Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

The dataset includes information about houses and their sale prices. Only three features were used in this task to train the model.

---

### 🚀 Model
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)
- **Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score
- **Output:** Predicted house prices in USD and converted to INR (₹) at current exchange rate.
